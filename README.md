Global Electric Vehicle Sales Analysis with SQL &amp; Power BI

# Electric Vehicle Market Trends & Insights (2010–2024)

This project analyzes global electric vehicle (EV) sales and market share trends using real-world data from Kaggle, SQL, and Power BI.

## Data Wrangling & SQL in Azure Data Studio

I began by exploring and cleaning the CSV in Excel, then moved to Azure Data Studio to write SQL queries that revealed the story behind the numbers.

## Project Summary

Through these steps, I mastered data cleansing techniques, learned to filter and aggregate with `GROUP BY`, and validated results to ensure accuracy.

### Visualization & Dashboard Design in Power BI

With my SQL-prepared data, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring:

- Line charts for overall EV sales growth and market share over time (filtered by parameter)
- Multi-line comparisons of BEV vs. PHEV trends (using powertrain as the legend)
- Bar chart of top countries by EV sales in 2024 (using Top N filters and excluding aggregates)
- KPI cards and maps to highlight total global sales and geographic distribution

I applied best-practice formatting—hiding redundant axis titles, fine-tuning gridlines, and crafting concise chart titles—to create a clean, executive-ready layout.

### Key Insights

- EV sales exploded from just thousands in 2010 to over 19 million units in 2024
- China, USA, and Germany lead by volume; Norway leads in market share
- BEV sales are rapidly outpacing PHEV, signaling a clear shift toward fully electric mobility

### What I Learned

- Advanced data cleansing and validation in SQL
- Crafting business questions that drive analysis (sales growth, market share, powertrain comparison)
- Designing interactive, user-focused dashboards in Power BI—complete with DAX measures, slicers, and polished visuals
- The power of data to not just report on the past but to predict future industry trends

### Main takeaway

Data isn’t just about looking back—it’s a window into the future. By visualizing EV sales and market trends, we gain actionable foresight into how innovation and sustainability will reshape transportation.
